# Publishing Data in GeoServer

In the first half of this tutorial, we will publish our data in GeoServer. This involves a few steps.

* [Obtaining the Data](/obtaining-the-data.md)
* [Creating a Data Store](/creating-a-data-store.md)
* [Publishing a Layer](/publishing-a-layer.md)

Throughout these sections, refer to the [Boundless GeoServer course](https://boundless.talentlms.com/unit/view/id:1642) \(requires a Boundless LMS account\) and the [GeoServer documentation](http://docs.geoserver.org/) when you need additional details.
